      Registration is closed at this moment. I'm hosting this app
      privately. I currently couldn't comply with the <a href="https://www.kmu.admin.ch/kmu/en/home/facts-and-trends/digitization/data-protection/new-federal-act-on-data-protection-nfadp.html">New Federal Act on Data Protection (nFADP)</a>,
      which is why I don't want to host any private data of other users.

      While I'm figuring out all that legal stuff you may <a href="https://github.com/koffeinfrei/unnote">get the source code from
      GitHub</a> and install it on a server on your own.
